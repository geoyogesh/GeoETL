//! Command-line interface for `GeoETL`, a high-performance geospatial data processing tool.
//!
//! This binary provides a user-friendly CLI to interact with the [`geoetl_core`] library,
//! enabling users to perform geospatial ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on
//! vector data formats.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The CLI is built using [`clap`] for argument parsing and [`tracing`] for structured logging.
//! It currently acts as a thin faÃ§ade that parses arguments, configures logging, and delegates
//! to command handlers. The full ETL pipeline implementation is under active development.
//!
//! # Available Commands
//!
//! - `convert` - Convert data between geospatial formats
//! - `info` - Display dataset information and metadata
//! - `drivers` - List all available format drivers and their capabilities
