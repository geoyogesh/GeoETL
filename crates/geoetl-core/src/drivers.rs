//! Driver registry for geospatial data format support and capabilities.
//!
//! This module provides a static registry of geospatial data format drivers, including
//! their current support status (supported, planned, or not supported) for various operations
//! (info, read, write). The registry is modeled after GDAL's driver system but designed for
//! modern Rust-based ETL workflows.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use geoetl_core::drivers::{find_driver, get_available_drivers};
//!
//! // Find a specific driver
//! let geojson = find_driver("GeoJSON").expect("GeoJSON driver should exist");
//! assert!(geojson.capabilities.read.is_supported());
//!
//! // List all drivers with supported operations
//! let available = get_available_drivers();
//! for driver in available {
//!     println!("{}: {}", driver.short_name, driver.long_name);
//! }
//! ```
