**TL;DR**: We're excited to announce the first release of GeoETL, a next-generation geospatial ETL tool built from the ground up with Rust, Apache DataFusion, and Apache Arrow. Our goal is ambitious: deliver 5-10x faster performance than GDAL while providing seamless scalability from your laptop to a distributed cluster.

## Why GeoETL?

For over two decades, GDAL has been the backbone of geospatial data processing. It's an incredible tool that has served the GIS community faithfully, and we owe a tremendous debt to its developers and contributors.

But the world of data has changed dramatically:

- **Hardware has evolved**: Modern CPUs have 8, 16, or even 64+ cores, but many GDAL operations remain single-threaded.
- **Data has grown**: We're now processing terabytes of geospatial data that won't fit on a single machine.
- **Cloud is everywhere**: Object storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS) has become the standard, but traditional tools weren't designed for it.
- **Memory safety matters**: Spatial data processing involves complex algorithms where memory bugs can be catastrophic.

GeoETL is our answer to these challenges. We're building a modern geospatial ETL tool that embraces the cutting-edge technologies available today while learning from decades of GDAL's wisdom.

## The Vision

**Our mission is to become the modern standard for vector spatial data processing**, empowering users with:

- **5-10x faster performance** than GDAL through vectorized, multi-threaded execution
- **Seamless scalability** from a single laptop to a distributed cluster
- **Memory safety** guaranteed by Rust's ownership model
- **Cloud-native architecture** with first-class support for S3, Azure Blob, and GCS
- **Zero legacy dependencies** - a clean, modern implementation without carrying decades of technical debt

## What's in v0.1.0?

This is our **foundation release** (Phase 1 of our roadmap). Think of it as laying the cornerstone of a building - it's not the complete structure, but it's solid, well-engineered, and ready to build upon.

### ✅ What Works Today

**Command-Line Interface**:
```bash
# List all 68+ supported format drivers
geoetl-cli drivers

# Convert between geospatial formats
geoetl-cli convert \
  -i cities.geojson \
  -o cities.csv \
  --input-driver GeoJSON \
  --output-driver CSV

# With verbose logging
geoetl-cli -v convert -i input.csv -o output.geojson \
  --input-driver CSV \
  --output-driver GeoJSON
```

**Currently Supported Formats**:
- ✅ **CSV** - Read and write CSV files with WKT geometries
- ✅ **GeoJSON** - Full read/write support for GeoJSON FeatureCollections

**Key Features**:
- **68+ Driver Registry**: We've catalogued 68+ vector format drivers (GeoJSON, Shapefile, GeoPackage, PostGIS, etc.) with their capabilities
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear error messages when something goes wrong
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Extensive end-to-end and unit tests ensure reliability
- **Professional CI/CD**: Automated testing and releases via CircleCI
- **Docker Support**: Consistent development environment

### 🚧 What's Coming Next

We're transparent about where we are: **2 of 68+ drivers are currently implemented**. Here's what's on the immediate roadmap:

**Phase 2 (Q2 2026)**:
- Implement high-priority format drivers: GeoPackage, Shapefile, Parquet, FlatGeobuf
- Driver auto-detection from file extensions
- Complete the `info` command for dataset inspection
- Core spatial operations (buffer, intersection, union)
- CRS transformations
- Performance benchmarking suite

**Phase 3-4 (Q3-Q4 2026)**:
- Advanced spatial algorithms
- Ballista integration for distributed processing
- Cloud storage support (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
- Horizontal scaling across clusters

## The Technology Stack

GeoETL is built on a foundation of cutting-edge, battle-tested technologies:

### Core Technologies

- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**: A systems programming language that guarantees memory safety without garbage collection. No more segfaults, data races, or undefined behavior.

- **[Apache DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/)**: A blazing-fast SQL query engine written in Rust. DataFusion provides:
  - **Vectorized execution**: Operations on entire columns at once
  - **Query optimization**: Sophisticated cost-based optimizer
  - **Extensibility**: Custom data sources and functions

- **[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)**: A language-agnostic columnar memory format that enables zero-copy data sharing and efficient analytical operations.

- **[GeoArrow](https://geoarrow.org/)**: An emerging standard for representing geospatial vector data in the Arrow columnar format.

### The GeoRust Ecosystem

We're proud members of the [GeoRust](https://github.com/georust) community, leveraging excellent Rust libraries:

- **[geo](https://docs.rs/geo/)**: Geospatial algorithms (area, centroid, distance, etc.)
- **[geozero](https://docs.rs/geozero/)**: Zero-copy geospatial data streaming
- **[proj](https://docs.rs/proj/)**: Coordinate reference system transformations
- **[rstar](https://docs.rs/rstar/)**: R-tree spatial indexing for fast queries

## Why Rust + DataFusion?

You might be wondering: "Why not just improve GDAL or build this in Python?"

### The Rust Advantage

**Memory Safety Without Performance Cost**:
Rust's ownership model eliminates entire classes of bugs at compile time - no null pointer dereferences, no buffer overflows, no use-after-free errors. And unlike garbage-collected languages, you get this safety with zero runtime overhead.

**Fearless Concurrency**:
Rust makes it impossible to have data races. This means we can parallelize operations across all your CPU cores without the complexity and bugs that plague multi-threaded C++ code.

**Zero-Cost Abstractions**:
We can write high-level, readable code that compiles down to machine code as fast as hand-optimized C. You shouldn't have to choose between performance and maintainability.

### The DataFusion Advantage

**Vectorized Processing**:
DataFusion operates on entire columns of data at once using SIMD instructions. This is fundamentally faster than row-by-row processing for analytical workloads.

**Distributed by Design**:
Through DataFusion Ballista, we get built-in distributed execution. Scale from one machine to hundreds without rewriting your code.

**Proven in Production**:
DataFusion powers [InfluxDB IOx](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-iox/), [Cube.js](https://cube.dev/), and other production systems processing billions of rows.

## Performance Goals

We're making bold claims about performance. Here are our specific targets:

| Operation | Target vs GDAL | Method |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Format conversion | 5-10x faster | Vectorized processing, zero-copy |
| Spatial filtering | 5x faster | R-tree indexing, SIMD |
| Buffer operations | 3-5x faster | Parallel execution |
| Spatial joins | 5x faster | Partition-based parallelism |
| Large datasets (1TB+) | Linear scaling | Distributed via Ballista |

**Important**: These are targets, not claims about v0.1.0. We'll be publishing benchmark results as we implement each feature. Transparency is key.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Currently, GeoETL must be built from source (pre-built binaries coming soon):

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.90.0 or later
git clone https://github.com/geoyogesh/geoetl.git
cd geoetl
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at: target/release/geoetl-cli
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# See all available format drivers
geoetl-cli drivers

# Convert GeoJSON to CSV
geoetl-cli convert \
  -i cities.geojson \
  -o cities.csv \
  --input-driver GeoJSON \
  --output-driver CSV

# Convert CSV with WKT geometries to GeoJSON
geoetl-cli convert \
  -i points.csv \
  -o points.geojson \
  --input-driver CSV \
  --output-driver GeoJSON \

## The Road Ahead

We have an ambitious roadmap, but we're committed to **incremental delivery**. Every month, you'll see progress:

- **New format drivers** being added
- **Performance benchmarks** published
- **Features implemented** from the roadmap
- **Documentation expanded** with more examples

This is a marathon, not a sprint. We're building GeoETL to last for the next decade and beyond.

## A Note on Realism

**Let's be clear**: GeoETL v0.1.0 is not a GDAL replacement today. GDAL has 20+ years of development, 250+ drivers, and battle-tested reliability. It will take us time to reach feature parity.

But we believe there's room for both tools:

- **GDAL** remains the gold standard for comprehensive format support and mature, stable processing
- **GeoETL** will excel at high-performance, cloud-native, distributed geospatial data processing

Think of GeoETL as complementary to GDAL, not competitive. Use the right tool for the job.
