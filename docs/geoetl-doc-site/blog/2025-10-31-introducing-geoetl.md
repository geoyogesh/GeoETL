Welcome to the first blog post for GeoETL! We are excited to introduce a new project that aims to revolutionize the world of geospatial data processing.

## What is GeoETL?

GeoETL is a modern, high-performance CLI tool for spatial data conversion and processing. It is designed to be a next-generation replacement for GDAL, the swiss-army knife of geospatial data processing that has served the community for decades.

## Why a new tool?

While GDAL is an amazing and powerful tool, it has some limitations in the modern data landscape. Many of its operations are single-threaded, and its architecture, which was revolutionary for its time, doesn't always take full advantage of modern hardware. Scaling to large datasets can be a challenge.

This is where GeoETL comes in. We believe there is an opportunity to build a new tool from the ground up, using modern technologies to provide a significant leap in performance, scalability, and developer experience.

## The GeoETL Vision

Our vision is **to become the modern standard for vector spatial data processing, empowering users with blazing-fast performance, seamless scalability, and an intuitive developer experience.**

We are building GeoETL on a foundation of cutting-edge technologies:

*   **Rust:** For memory safety and high performance.
*   **Apache Arrow and DataFusion:** For a powerful, vectorized query engine and in-memory analytics.
*   **The GeoRust Ecosystem:** To leverage a growing ecosystem of high-quality geospatial libraries.

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features we are building into GeoETL:

*   **High Performance:** 5-10x faster than GDAL for many common operations.
*   **Scalable:** From a single laptop to a distributed cluster.
*   **Cloud Native:** First-class support for cloud storage like S3, Azure Blob, and GCS.
*   **Modern Architecture:** A clean, modern implementation without legacy dependencies.

## Get Involved!

GeoETL is an open-source project, and we are just getting started. We welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you want to report bugs, suggest features, or contribute code, we'd love your help.

*   **Vision Document:** [Read our full vision for the project](https://github.com/geoyogesh/geoetl/blob/main/docs/VISION.md)

We are excited about the future of geospatial data processing, and we believe that GeoETL will be a big part of it. Stay tuned for more updates!
