# Welcome to GeoETL

**GeoETL** is a modern, high-performance CLI tool for geospatial data conversion and processing, built with Rust and Apache DataFusion.

Let's get you started with **GeoETL in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is GeoETL?

GeoETL is designed to be a next-generation alternative to traditional geospatial ETL tools, offering:

- **High Performance**: 5-10x faster processing through vectorized execution
- **Memory Safety**: Built with Rust for guaranteed memory safety
- **Modern Architecture**: Leverages Apache DataFusion and Apache Arrow
- **Scalability**: From single-machine to distributed processing (coming soon)
- **68+ Format Drivers**: Support for GeoJSON, CSV, Shapefile, GeoPackage, and more

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial will teach you:

âœ… **Installation** - How to install and build GeoETL
âœ… **Basic Operations** - Converting data between formats
âœ… **Working with Data** - Understanding drivers and formats
âœ… **Advanced Features** - Performance tips and best practices

## What You'll Need

### System Requirements

- **A computer** running Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Command-line terminal** - Terminal, PowerShell, or Command Prompt
- That's it! The pre-built binary is self-contained.

:::note Building from Source
If you want to build from source instead, you'll need Rust 1.90.0+ and Git.
See [Installation Guide](./tutorial-basics/installation) for details.
:::

### Recommended

- Basic command-line knowledge
- Familiarity with geospatial data formats (GeoJSON, CSV, etc.)
- A text editor for viewing data files

## Quick Start

Get the latest release from GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Download from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/geoyogesh/geoetl/releases

# 2. Extract the archive
tar -xzf geoetl-cli-*.tar.gz  # Linux/macOS
# or extract the .zip on Windows

# 3. Run your first command
./geoetl-cli drivers
```

You should see a table of 68+ supported format drivers!

**â†’ See the [Installation Guide](./tutorial-basics/installation) for detailed step-by-step instructions.**
